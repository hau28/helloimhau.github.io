As we can see, international students are more interested in science-related subjects like Electrical engineering and Information technology than UK students. However, it is opposite when referring to social fields such as English literature, Art history, Sociology or International law where UK students show better performance. Nursing and Accountancy are two subjects that show no differences between international and UK students.

Overall, the graph shows that when talking about the percentage of students gaining second class degrees or better at a major UK university, international students have higher results in science subjects while UK students are better at social ones and they both perform well in Nursing and Accountancy.

## Model answer

The bar chart shows the proportion of UK students and international students achieving second class degrees or higher in seven different subjects at a university in the UK.

Degree results were generally good for both home and international students, with well over 50 per cent gaining a second class degree or better in all seven subjects except International Law. International students tended to do better than UK students in technology-related subjects. This was particularly true of Information Technology. Whereas over 80 per cent of international students gained a good degree in IT, only about half of the UK students did so.

Degree results were similar for the two groups in Nursing and Accounting. In Arts and Social Science-related subjects, UK students tended to do better. The biggest gap in performance was in International Law, where three-quarter of UK students gained a second class degree or better. In contrast, fewer than half of the international students attained this level.

Overall, the chart suggests that international and UK students had different strengths when studying for degrees in this UK university.

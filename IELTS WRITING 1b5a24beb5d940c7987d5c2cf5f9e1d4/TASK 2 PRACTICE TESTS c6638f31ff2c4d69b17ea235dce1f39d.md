## Model answer

Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world.

There are clearly certain advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam question, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay task, can test different sort of reasoning ability. However, exams also have clear drawbacks. Test-wise candidate can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. On the other hand, some test-takers perform poorly in exams simply because of anxiety. Some teachers and learners focus only on those aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.

address the advantages and disadvantages of exams

A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of learning environment. Exam tasks should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered; assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.
